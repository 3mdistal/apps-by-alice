I've been playing the piano since I was a little kid. And watching my parents play since before then. Music, perhaps, is in my blood.

I never loved the piano until I took a break from it in high school. Began to learn how to sing. Even when I wasn't playing, I always had melodies rattling around my head.

It was in college I started to improvise. In the privacy of soundproof practice rooms, I could let go of some of the expectations put on me and listen to what I actually wanted to create.

Some of those improvisations go on to become something more, and for a while now, I've been learning the ins and outs of sound design and production. I use Bitwig Studio and a whole lot of soft synths and other instruments. I'll detail my process more sometime it's more organized, but suffice it to say for now that I splash around in software until something sounds right.

Recently, I've gotten more serious, trimming my instincts into more palatable songs. Those I'll be sharing here when I get the chance.
