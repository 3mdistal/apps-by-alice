# Welcome to Tempo Immaterial, the studio of Alice Alexandra Moore

Although my actual studio is far better viewed on the live version of the site, this repo is for anyone curious about my design implementations.

While I'm not yet looking for contributions to the codebase, **please feel free to leave issues if you notice any bugs or have an idea of how something can be refactored.** I work in public in order to learn (and teach where I can). And, I'm currently working on opening up this space for more community engagement and eventual collaboration.

I also hope to clean up and make usable some of the most unique components of this project. These include:
- Homepage / landing page design with sections determined by SVG clip paths.
- Animations and transitions, many of which are dynamically calculated by container.
- Notion CMS logic.
- General content design.

In the meantime, enjoy the mess that's here. Lots of components are in-between implementations (half one thing, half another). I hope to refactor everything to be more consistent soon, but right now I'm in a *at least it works* phase as I prepare to share my blog and studio content more on my social media.
