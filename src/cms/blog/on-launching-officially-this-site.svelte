<p>
    Maybe you've looked around Tempo Immaterial a bit before now. I've linked it
    in my social bios for a while, but I've never made a post about it.
</p>

<p>But now I'm officially launching. So, what's new?</p>

<h2 id="1">Why is there a new site?</h2>

<p>
    I started this site in Summer 2022, after hitting the creative limitations
    of a heavily Frankensteined Squarespace template. It had custom components
    and styling just glued willy nilly and was looking <em>way</em> too similar to
    my brain.
</p>

<p>
    I'd been custom-coding client sites for a while, and I wanted to give myself
    a similar fresh start. I made a huge wishlist, died of overwhelm, and
    resurrected myself by circling the 10% of things on the wishlist that
    actually needed to happen for a functional site.

        üí° This site is made entirely with SvelteKit deployed to Vercel. You can
        <a
            href="https://github.com/3mdistal/portfolio"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            class="font-medium hover:underline">visit my Github</a
        >
        to see the code and quickly realize that everything is held together by sheer
        willpower. The <code>readme</code> and <code>changelog</code> will give you
        a better picture of my technical hopes.
    </p>
    <p></p>

<p>
    So, I wrote the 1000s of lines of code sometime between navigating a move to
    the UK from Egypt and starting a new job as a Content Engineer at Vercel.
    Now I've finally used enough weekends and espresso to call it ready for
    visitors.
</p>

<p>
    That doesn't, by any stretch of the imagination, mean you won't find bugs.
    I'd really appreciate any feedback on broken shit; you tech folks can <a
        href="https://github.com/3mdistal/portfolio"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer"
        class="font-medium hover:underline"
    >
        log an issue on Github</a
    >, and the rest of you can
    <a href="/connect" class="font-medium hover:underline">
        spam my various inboxes</a
    >.
</p>

<p>
    Please make the issue sound like the end of the world, as this increases
    developer velocity.
</p>

<h2 id="2">Nerding out about design choices</h2>

<p>I want a site that makes people smile.</p>

<p>
    I love a clean-looking application, but boy am I tired of Apple derivative.
    I think I can count on one hand the fonts I encounter in a day.
</p>

<p>
    And I'm not saying that's bad, but I definitely want something that lets
    folks take a break from the rest of the Internet, even if some of those
    risky designs don't always work out at first.
</p>

<p>
    The biggest departure from the norm was combining my homepage and menu into
    one. When you land on the site you have five options. This is risky from a
    UX perspective: will users bounce off the site because of choice paralysis?
    But I also come at it from a games philosophy background: when you offer
    someone a simple choice, they become more invested in the journey to follow.
</p>

<p>
    The real trick, then, is to make sure the choice feels as clear as possible:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Curious what the site is? About.</li>
    <li>Came here to work with me? Commissions.</li>
    <li>Want to read the blog? .¬†.¬†.¬†Blog.</li>
    <li>Just wanna chat? Connect</li>
</ul>

<p>
    ‚ÄúStudio‚Äù is the option I struggled with. I knew I wanted my own creative
    work to have a dedicated section, but since my work doesn't fit into one
    medium or genre, I needed a word to encapsulate it. I still think it's more
    confusing than the others, so if you have any suggestions, I'm open.
</p>

<p>
    The rest of the design, then, needs to tell the user that the choice is
    super low stakes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Pastels</strong>, to me, scream <em>relax</em>. Er, say
        <em>relax</em>
        soothingly. While I have a dark mode planned, and I'm definitely still developing
        the site's visual identity, I feel like the homepage and tops of each landing
        page give me the palette I'd like to smear over the rest of the site.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Shape language</strong> is another aspect of the site that I want
        to push. It's clear on the homepage but quickly lost elsewhere. This will
        just take time and technical skill. Working with the shapes on the homepage
        wasn't an easy programming task (as anyone who's worked with `clip-path`
        might know). I need to find more efficient ways to translate weird shapes
        to all screen sizes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Animations</strong> <em>really</em> tell the user it's okay to have
        fun. However, animations can just as easily confuse when done poorly. It's
        a constant balancing act of fun vs. annoying, and I've been on too many sites
        whose overwrought animations make me disengage with content. I'm definitely
        still finding what works, and as the person who uses my site the most, I've
        edited animations to be faster far more frequently than slower.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Luckily, in all of this, I have so many great inspirations to look to. I'm
    constantly on tech Twitter and <a
        href="https://www.awwwards.com"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer"
        class="font-medium hover:underline">Awwwards</a
    > harvesting new techniques. Despite what I've said above about sites feeling
    stale, we live in a wealth of ideas, if you know where to look. I'll write more
    about inspirations in the near future.
</p>

<h2 id="3">What to expect from the blog</h2>

<p>
    I've been even quieter than usual the past two years on socials, besides the
    occasional illustration. While there's a lot of personal reasons for that I
    hope to write about later, I can safely say now that I'm going to be
    breaking that silence.
</p>

<p>
    For me, the blog is a space for less edited content than my studio work,
    which tends to ferment for literal years. It's a place for me to be me in a
    very unpolished way, which enables me to engage with my communities without
    so much pretense.
</p>

<p>
    And I have a lot of communities. I'm passionate about the worlds of web
    technology, gaming, literary fiction and fantasy, music productions, digital
    art, poetry, movies, and so much more. Despite all the best advice telling
    me to pick a niche, I don't feel the need.
</p>

<p>
    I will, however, develop a categorization system for the blog, so you can
    easily find content that interests you and skip the rest. That also will
    help me to write specifically to each audience.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, I'll be using the blog to keep you posted about studio releases,
    website updates, and other life changes. I've also played with the idea of a
    newsletter, but maybe that's too 2010s. Let me know what you prefer!
</p>

<h2 id="4">Waxing philosophical about creating in public</h2>

<p>
    For those of you who were readers of my old site, you may be asking, ‚ÄúWhy
    did you take down all your writing?‚Äù
</p>

<p>To which I honestly answer, I haven't coded that part of the site yet.</p>

<p>
    But it's also given me a chance to think, deeply, about what I've created
    and where I want to focus my efforts moving forward. About how I want to
    draw attention to the content I've worked so hard on.
</p>

<p>
    While more formal publication has been (and will still be) in the cards for
    much of my work, I'm also motivated to create my own distribution method to
    best serve the content.
</p>

<p>
    What do I mean by this? My poems often have long lines or tricky formatting.
    I've sometimes photoshopped stories to creatively destroy the text. While
    journals have graciously accepted these experimental pieces, I have seen a
    lot of compromises made to fit the works in print or on the web.
</p>

<p>
    Also, I don't want to share work when it feels <em>stale</em> to me. Writers
    often wait years before seeing work accepted, and longer before it's actually
    published. Often many years. By the time the readers engages, the author has
    moved on.
</p>

<p>
    I want to engage with you on work that's coming from where I am now. Yeah,
    that's way more vulnerable, but it also allows me to learn and better my
    art.
</p>

<p>
    I'm planning to take this a step further in my studio, too: I'm going to
    publish both finished and unfinished work here, gaining valuable feedback
    from my very digital community. I'll mark clearly which is which, so you can
    decide how you wish to engage.
</p>

<p>
    All this to say that right now you can head over to my studio and see, well,
    a whole lot of teasers. If you're interested‚Äîgreat, go read! If you want the
    tl;dr‚Äî<em>lots o' content coming very soon</em>.
</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>
    More than anything, I want to convey how much of this‚Äîthe site, the content,
    the very act of creation‚Äîis a process with which I'm going to be more
    transparent. I'm so tired of writing things and not sharing. Of learning and
    not teaching. My professional life has taught me how to work more in public,
    how to worry less about perfection and care a lot more about spreading
    knowledge. How to accept feedback earlier and save a whole bunch of time and
    effort.
</p>

<p>
    So, expect jank. Expect broken web pages. Expect creative work that has its
    spark buried under too much text.
</p>

<p>
    But also expect some great things. I've always loved rising to a challenge.
