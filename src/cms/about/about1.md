I needed a place for everything. If you're a creative like me, you might understand the urge to combine all your work, to try to keep it in one place. That, in essence, is what *Tempo Immaterial* is, but it's also a powerful reminder: that I am and always will be in progress.

This website, as you might notice, is incomplete. I lovingly call it the eternal beta. The fact of the matter is, as a solo designer and developer who thrives taking on complex ideas, I might never iron out everything, but I'll always be improving.

And yet, I hope you can see the site for what else it is: my best attempt to offer a little beauty to a world that too often looks hideous. To teach and learn all at once. To sustain myself, financially and emotionally, through creative work while trying to make it all mean something. All work here—from art to design to writing to music—is my own.

So, take your time. There's much to discover if you have the patience. I know I did, and it was well worth it.
