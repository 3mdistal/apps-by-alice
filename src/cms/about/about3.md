**I expect myself to be a specific version of excellent.**

I eschew conformity in my art only to find myself grasping at others' measures of success to weigh my work against.

In talking with a dear friend recently, we came to the conclusion that *questions exist not solely to be answered, but rather, too, as spelunkers for deeper questions*.

That each idea, once explored, is revealed to be a multitude of uncharted worlds.

**If art is to be mimesis, must it not, as life, remain incomplete?**

I've been trying to make a website for a few years now: a place to house all my work that doesn't seem to fit anywhere else. What always stopped me dead was how much my work, when joined together, asks so many more questions than it answersâ€”feels, in other words, desperately unfinished.

**How arrogant to think I'd be the only voice to ask & answer.**

This place, instead, I'm making the *terra sancta* I know how to create right now, without all the knowledge I've yet to see before I die. Perhaps instead of this studio being a declaration, I can posture myself into the shape of a question mark:

**Will you teach me what you know?**
