    If you're a creative like me, you might understand the urge to combine all
    your work, to try to make sense of it in one central hub. That, in essence,
    is what *Tempo Immaterial* is about.

    This website, as you might notice, is incomplete. I lovingly call it the
    eternal beta. As a solo designer and developer who thrives taking on complex
    ideas, I might never iron out everything, but I'll <a
        style="color:{accent}"
        class="hover:underline font-medium"
        href="https://github.com/3mdistal/portfolio"
        rel="noreferrer"
        target="_blank">always be improving</a
    >.
</p>

<p>
    And yet, I hope you can see the site for what else it is: my best attempt to
    offer a little beauty to a world that too often looks hideous. To teach and
    learn all at once. To sustain myself through creative work while trying to
    make it mean something.

    <strong style="color: {accent}">So, take your time. I know I did.</strong>
