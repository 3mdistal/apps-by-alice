	Something about the landscape has resided in me to this day, even as I've shed the backwards
	ideologies of Southern Baptist cults threaded through my veins. As a closeted trans woman, I
	learned not to discard the white supremacist neo-fascism, but to understand itâ€”to learn how an
	entire people can become so misled and to hope in art that resonates with the heart when so many
	political discussions fall on deaf ears.

	After leaving Ohio, I stayed in the Midwest, pursuing postgraduate work in Muncie, Indiana, coming
	out to myself as trans, and learning how to cope with the different ways adhd affects my everyday
	life. These were some of the hardest times I ever experienced, but I grew through them, developing
	an urge to participate in so many communities I'd been blind to.

	The last few years have found me in a different space. I've always loved creating all shades of
	art, and I thrive most when I'm learning a new way to do something. Often, my brain pushes me into
	new territory before I've finished old projects, but I've learned to appreciate all the
	"incomplete" works I've made along the way. Finally, through this site, I'm sharing so many of
	them.

<p>
	Currently, I'm working as a Content Engineer for Vercel, and continuing my various creative
	projects. If you're interested in collaborating, please send me your idea, and we can brainstorm
	together to make something extraordinary.
