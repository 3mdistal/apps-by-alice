While it's fun to have a lot of major works in progress, I also find myself craving the new.

I figure, if I make a spot for one-offs, I won't feel forced to make everything fit perfectly together. There can be, as there always will be, some mess.

Flash fiction, weird comics, stories, and essays that don't fit anywhere else: welcome. Looking forward to meeting you.
