Poetry has always been my first language. Mashing words together in ways they shouldn't brings sparks like nothing I've felt.

And yet, I hardly find the time to write it. No, that's not quite right. I hardly put in the work it takes to bring my thoughts out in verse, to edit edit edit edit edit them into something beautiful.

When I do, I feel a sense of accomplishment that's hard to replicate. I've been privileged in my life to have the time to write. And I'll continue as I'm able. This is a chronicle of sorts. If you'll forgive me, this is the one time I get ultra-personal without so much of a mask.

Sometimes I think these poems are just for me. But there's value in the sharing them out. Value in letting someone somewhere know that they're not alone in their fearsome mind.
