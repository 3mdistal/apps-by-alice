		<p>So, I'm doing something a bit unhinged.</p>
		<p>
			I've been obsessed with making games for years. In that time, I've taught myself so much about
			game design, music creation, art, storyâ€”essentially everything except for coding the actual
			game.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've tries a few game engines and I've found them tough to use, largely because they require a
			lot of memorization, and I work best when I understand the whole system.
		</p>
		<p>
			The past few years I've been very into web development, and while I knew in the back of my
			head that making games inside of JavaScript is possible, it never really clicked with me that
			this would be the most fun way to do it, since it requires making all your own physics,
			organization, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, I'm going to be just . . . making shit here, and I'll start sharing this page out once
			they're any good, but for now it's just a new project every day or so until I understand
			what's going on. I'll chart my progress here.
