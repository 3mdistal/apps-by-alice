            Disparate connections drive us through life. We're always picking up
            on fragments of history, never getting the full story. In the
            fantasy world of TMI, a huge cast of characters in a multitude of
            places explore their lives through an impossible lens of the past:
            one where the world itself has shifted, scrambling itself beyond
            recognition.

            These Makeshift Idiotika is a long work-in-progress. I've been
            hacking away at lore, character arcs, and the overall story flow for
            over eight years. It's gone through various mediums, from graphic
            novel to short stories to what now is a video game I'm developing in
            my free time.

            It's daunting, to be honest, to keep track of it all on my own. This
            story has gone through many periods of advisement from others, and I
            see the game will, too. Right now, I'm working on improving my 3D
            art skills and my programming in Godot game engine. It's slow, but
            rewarding, to tell the story the way I want.

            Here on the site I'll be keeping you updated on my progress, but
            more than that, I'll be starting to show you the intricate world of
            the idiotika. You'll be meeting characters as I get art finished,
            you'll hear music as I compose themes, and you'll tour new places as
            they get shifted around the world.

            So, here's to sharing the complicated things that go on in our
            minds. To giving voice to what feels impossible to express.
