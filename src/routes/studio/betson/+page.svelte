            To say I've been trying to write about the Ohio I grew up in ever
            since growing up there is an understatement. I've tried nonfiction,
            to varying degrees of success, but the only way I seem to be able to
            come at the complexity of the land and its people, the simultaneity
            of destructive cults and thriving forests taking root, is through
            fiction.

            Betson is my mirror dimension, a place my memories don't have to be
            accurate, where they can feel like it felt for me without sticking
            to the facts. It's also a town full of people I've come to love in
            my ten years writing stories centered here, and one I'm going to be
            sharing a lot more of very soon.

            I've published some work in the past: a story called "The Goat
            Hunters," excerpts from a labyrinthine boarding house passed through
            generations of family, an odd chronicle about a steer dead on the
            road in 1857. To say the least, there's a lot more where this stuff
            comes from, and I'm so excited to be publishing it in a more
            logical, organized collection.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll be sharing out all the work here first. I'm a firm believer in
            getting feedback from my immediate community, seeing how my writing
            hits or doesn't. From there, we'll see where I take it next, but
            stay tuned to see the stories here first.
