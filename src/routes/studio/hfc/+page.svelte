            Poetry has always been my first language. Mashing words together in
            ways they shouldn't brings sparks like nothing I've felt.

            And yet, I hardly find the time to write it. No, that's not quite
            right. I hardly put in the work it takes to bring my thoughts out in
            verse, to edit edit edit edit edit them into something beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I do, I feel a sense of accomplishment that's hard to
            replicate. I've been privileged in my life to have the time to
            write. And I'll continue as I'm able. This is a chronicle of sorts.
            If you'll forgive me, this is the one time I get ultra-personal
            without so much of a mask.

            Sometimes I think these poems are just for me. But there's value in
            the sharing them out. Value in letting someone somewhere know that
            they're not alone in their fearsome mind.
